======================
Let's admit it - we are all lazy. That's why I built the [Hyper-TLDR website](https://hyper-tldr.herokuapp.com/).
Paste in any link and how long you are wiling to read, and viola.

Chrome Extension of HyperTLDR built for [HyperTLDR Web](https://github.com/theyangyu96/hyper-tldr-web). Part of the Capital One Software Engineering Summit
